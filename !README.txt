	two important things to note:

		- the path to the sdk in the local.properties file is set up for my machine, 
			so if you run into errors when trying to run the program, you may have to 
			change this file to reflect the path on your machine.

		- in order for the drag functionality to work, you have to long click on a piece 
			and then you will be able to drag. for the life of me I couldn't get this 
			to work any other way, I hope this is ok.
